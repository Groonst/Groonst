## 🚀 My Projects

### Stroke risk factors analysis (Data science project)
**Python | Pandas | Statistical Analysis | Data Visualization | Jupyter Notebook**

🔗 [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Groonst/Stroke_analysis)

A comprehensive statistical analysis of stroke risk factors using healthcare data, demonstrating data science skills and ability to derive clinically relevant insights.

**Key Findings:**
- Age is the strongest predictor (median 71 vs 43 years, p<0.001)
- Elevated glucose levels increase risk (+15% median, p<0.001)
- Hypertension patients have 3.3× higher stroke prevalence
- Heart disease patients show 4.1× higher stroke occurrence

**Analysis Features:**
- Automated data cleaning (BMI imputation, categorical conversion)
- Advanced statistical testing (t-tests, chi-square)
- Publication-quality visualizations (Seaborn/Matplotlib)
- Clinical significance evaluation (-log10 p-values)
- Presentation-ready output formatting

**What It Demonstrates:**
- Proficiency in Python data science stack (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy)
- End-to-end statistical analysis capabilities
- Ability to translate technical findings into actionable insights
- Strong data visualization skills
- Professional results presentation

**Clinical Recommendations:**
- Prioritize screening for patients >70 years (3× higher risk)
- Aggressive blood pressure control for hypertensive patients
- Annual glucose checks for patients >50 years
- Enhanced cardiac monitoring for heart disease patients
